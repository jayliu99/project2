Breadth-first search

# What is BFS?
Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm used to search unweighted graphs. Each "layer" of a network is fully explored before moving onto the next layer. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(V+E), where V is the total number of nodes and E is the total number of edges in the network. BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path between nodes.
